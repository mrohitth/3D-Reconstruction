<p align = "justify"> 7-point and 8-point algorithm for 3D Reconstruction. Bundle Adjustment, RANSAC algorithm and multiview reconstruction also performed. <br> <br>
This is a part of the work I have done during my Masters at Carnegie Mellon University. The Problem Statement is from a course -> (16-720B) Computer Vision. Results were achieved under the guidance of Prof. Deva Kannan Ramanan and his Teaching Assistants. <br> <br>
The zip folder has the important parts of the assignment, including all the theory and the code. Please do not plagiarize if you're taking the course. </p>
